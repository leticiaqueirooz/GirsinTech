            <p>
              We are <strong>Let√≠cia</strong> and <strong>Marina</strong>, computer science graduates from the 
              <em>National College of Ireland</em> and nowadays we are together creating
              this collaborative platform called <em>"Girls in Tech"</em>.
              <br><br>
              When we met we were in college while we were
              almost going crazy trying to survive the studies and work, 
              we shared difficulties and victories and
              through this, we saw that together we were even stronger.
              <br><br>
              We are women who have navigated this industry and seen how gender equality has been disregarded.
              And having experienced many difficult moments during our studies,
              we decided to join forces to change this situation.
              With this in mind, we united knowledge with whoever else wants to join and/or is
              in need of some help in everyday life.
              <br><br>
              Girls <strong>supporting</strong> girls; <em>this is what motivates us</em>, every day more. üí™üíñ <br /><br />
