                Even in 2022, there is still a gender gap in STEM and the
                broader tech economy.<br /><br />

                The UNESCO Science Report 2021 shows that women are still
                underrepresented in computing, engineering, mathematics, and
                physics. They make up only 28% of engineering graduates, and
                only three out of ten researchers are female.<br /><br />

                Women are still underrepresented in technical and leadership
                roles even in tech companies whose policies are becoming more
                inclusive. According to a pilot survey conducted by EQUALS
                Global Partnership, 58% of female senior and mid-level managers
                in technology businesses identify as "transformational leaders,"
                and their teams perceive them to be more "democratic and
                compassionate." Despite this, seven out of ten of them believe
                they are treated differently at work due to their gender.

                Increasing diversity in STEM degrees remains a problem for all
                higher education institutions. And women often describe what it
                is like to be in an embarrassing situation as a result of a
                predominantly male study/workplace culture. <br /><br />
                After interviewing and researching across the campus of the
                National College of Ireland, we came to the conclusion, based on
                the actual results and accounts of our research, we could see up
                close that the gender gap is more common than we are aware of
                its harms. And with that in mind, we must take matters into our
                own hands and change the course of history.<br />
                By providing our services to female students, we will be able to
                contribute to the solution of encouraging more women to pursue
                careers in technology. Students who participate will receive our
                assistance in solving technology challenges in their study in a
                fair environment.
